## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have authored and continue to maintain many opensource libraries, mostly focused around tooling to make developers and opensource authors lives easier and deliver higher quality software, faster.

Most of my repositories can be found under the [Nimbly](https://github.com/nimbly) organization.

## Some of my libraries
* [Proof](https://github.com/nimbly/Proof) - A secure library capable of generating, signing, validating, and decoding JWTs.
* [Plaid SDK](https://github.com/TomorrowIdeas/plaid-sdk-php) - PHP SDK for Plaid - banking integration APIs.
* [Resolve](https://github.com/nimbly/Resolve) - A library that can add dependency resolution and injection to your code.
* [Limber](https://github.com/nimbly/Limber) - A lightweight and fast HTTP micro-framework that supports PSR-7, 15, and 11.
* [Capsule](https://github.com/nimbly/Capsule) - A PSR-7 HTTP Message implementation.
* [Announce](https://github.com/nimbly/Announce) - A PSR-14 Event Dispatcher implementation.

## Current projects

Lately I am focusing on an event-driven framework, making publishing and consuming messages easy, intuitive, and painless to setup. It's called [Syndicate](https://github.com/nimbly/Syndicate).

## My dev toolchain
* Dell XPS-13
* Linux (Pop-OS)
* VS Code
* Docker
* Github & Github Actions
* Codecov

## Day-to-day

Although I have spent many years as a software engineer, I have moved into more of a leadership role within organizations as an Engineering Manager and more recently as Director of Engineering. Feel free to checkout my [website and resume](https://brentscheffler.com).
